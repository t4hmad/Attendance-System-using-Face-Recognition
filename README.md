Attendance management is a critical aspect of educational institutions.
Ensuring that students attend classes regularly and on time.
Traditional methods of attendance tracking, such as manual roll calls, are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and susceptible to manipulation.
This project proposes the development of an automated School Attendance System using Facial Recognition technology to streamline the process.
Enhance accuracy, and provide real-time updates to parents about their child's attendance.
